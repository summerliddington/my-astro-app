## Astro Collective

By Summer Liddington

## About
Brief Proposal: An app that lets the user create a profile of their personal astrology chart (natal chart would be stretch goal) and then either create or join a group/collective to see how their astrology profile relates to other users within that group.

Reasoning behind this idea: When groups of people come together for a reason itâ€™s always intriguing to see the personality similarities and differences between one another. Much like the other personality tests out there, astrology can be used as another way to understand others underlying characteristics without taking them to therapy.
