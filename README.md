## Astro Collective

By Summer Liddington

## Brief Proposal
An app that lets the user create a profile of their personal astrology chart and then be able to either create or join a group (aka collective). The user can then to see how their astrology profile relates to other users within that group that they join and add users to a group that they create.

Reasoning behind this idea: When groups of people come together for a reason itâ€™s always intriguing to see the personality similarities and differences between one another. Much like the other personality tests out there, astrology can be used as another way to understand other's underlying characteristics without taking them to therapy.

## Challenge Statement
How might we create an application that allows atrology enthusiasts compare natal charts of more than 2 people?
